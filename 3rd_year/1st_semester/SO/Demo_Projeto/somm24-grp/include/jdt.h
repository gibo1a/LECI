/**
 * \defgroup jdt JDT -- Job Description Table
 *
 * \details
 *  The simulation is driven by an input array (\c jobDescriptionTable), 
 *  representing a sequence of jobs, that will be submitted to the system.
 *
 *  The relevant data for every job is:
 *  - the time of submission
 *  - the time it takes to execute 
 *  - the size of its logical address space
 *  
 *   The supporting data structure is a fixed-size static array.
 *
 *   The following table presents a list of the functions in this module, including:
 *   - the function name;
 *   - the function ID, that can be used to switch between the binary and group version;
 *   - an estimation of the effort required to implement it;
 *   - a brief description of the function role.
 *   <table>
 *   <tr> <th> \c function <th align="center"> function ID <th align="center"> level <th>role
